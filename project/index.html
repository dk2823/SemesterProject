    <td class="tg-031e" colspan="2"> The purpose of this app is to allow users to customize their salad by clicking
on a variety of ingredients to choose from and have a dynamic imaged display right before the users eyes. At first 
launch the user will be prompted to either create login credentials, or login with their username. Once the user has 
logged in they will be taken to the salad design page where there will be an empty plate and a swipeable row of 
ingredients at the bottom. The users will select the ingredients they want in their salad. and have a chose of a 
restaurant. As the user clicks on 
ingredients, the plate will slowly see all of their items combining and making the finished product. The user is also
able to remove ingredients they choose not to have in there salad. Once they are 
done constructing the salad they will be taken to a confirmation screen to be able to view all ingredients and the 
total price. From this point the user will be able to track the progress of their salad 
creation and at the end it will display order number/address to the restaurant to go pick it up.
</br>Testing: Manually tested on API level 22 on both emulator and android phones.
			</br>Development Environment: Android Studio
